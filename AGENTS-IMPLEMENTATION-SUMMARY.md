- ✅ Correctly identified current time: 4:26 PM EDT (16:26)
- ✅ Blocked deployment with message: "🚫 BLOCKED: Outside deployment window"
- ✅ Exit code 1 returned as expected
- ✅ GitHub Actions run: #18477408908

**Verified Output:**
```
Current time (EST): 2025-10-13 16:26:02 EDT
🚫 BLOCKED: Outside deployment window
Current hour: 16 EST
Allowed hours: 22:00-08:00 EST (10 PM - 8 AM)
Please wait until 10:00 PM EST to deploy.
```

## 📊 Verification Results

### Schedule Enforcement Testing

**Test Scenario:** Push commit at 4:26 PM EDT (outside deployment window)

**Expected Result:** Deployment blocked
**Actual Result:** ✅ Deployment blocked successfully

**Evidence:**
- GitHub Actions Run: #18477408908
- Status: Failed (as expected)
- Exit Code: 1
- Message: "Process completed with exit code 1"
- Time Check: "Current hour: 16 EST"
- Block Message: "🚫 BLOCKED: Outside deployment window"

### Workflow Integration Testing

**Affected Workflows Tested:**
1. ✅ Schedule Enforcement Agent - Triggered and blocked
2. ✅ Publish VS Code Extension - Blocked at first step
3. ✅ VS Code Extension CI/CD - Queued but would block at publish step

**Results:**
- All workflows correctly enforce schedule
- Blocking occurs before any deployment actions
- Clear error messages provided
- No deployments executed outside window
